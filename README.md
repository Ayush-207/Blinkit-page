# Blinkit-page

Built the products screen of Blinkit using UIKit

Installation 
1. XCode

No 3rd party dependencies used. 

Keynotes - 
1. Followed the MVVM design pattern. 
2. Network layer was not required in the assignment so I have made JSON stubs and and just for the sake of following the design patterns have used an API Manager.
